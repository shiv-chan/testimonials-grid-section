					I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were

					“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been
					looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an
					amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and
					found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12
					weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since
					completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as
					a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

					Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves.
					Getting guidance from them and learning from their experiences was

				<p class="main-text">
					“ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find
					really refreshing. The program gave me the confidence necessary to be

					Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!
				</p>
				<p class="main-text">
					“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I
					needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn
					programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
					student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program.
					The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very
					hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
					project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the
					next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve
					often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent
					experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack
					developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”
